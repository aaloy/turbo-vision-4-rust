// (C) 2025 - Enzo Lombardi

//! Form layout - build a dialog from a list of fields, with no coordinates.
//!
//! A [`Form`] lays out a [`Dialog`] for you: labels in one column, fields in
//! the next, buttons centred along the bottom, and the dialog sized to fit
//! and centred on the screen. You say *what* goes in the form, in order; the
//! form decides *where* it goes.
//!
//! ```
//! use turbo_vision::core::geometry::Rect;
//! use turbo_vision::views::GroupLike;
//! use turbo_vision::views::checkbox::CheckBox;
//! use turbo_vision::views::form::{Form, size};
//! use turbo_vision::views::input_line::InputLine;
//!
//! let mut form = Form::new("Customer");
//! // No size: the field stretches to the width of the field column.
//! let name = form.field("~N~ame", InputLine::new(Rect::default(), 40));
//!
//! // A titled box around the rows up to `end_group`.
//! form.group("Address");
//! let street = form.field("~S~treet", InputLine::new(Rect::default(), 60));
//! // Several fields on one line; a size keeps it (8 columns, 1 row).
//! let mut line = form.line();
//! let city = line.field("~C~ity", InputLine::new(Rect::default(), 40));
//! let zip = line.field("~Z~IP", InputLine::new(size(8, 1), 8));
//! form.end_group();
//!
//! // A row with no label, aligned with the fields.
//! let vip = form.field("", CheckBox::new(Rect::default(), "VIP customer"));
//! form.ok_cancel();
//! let mut dialog = form.build();
//!
//! // Run it with `dialog.execute(&mut app)`; then read the values back
//! // through the handles the form returned:
//! let name_text = dialog.get(name).map(|f| f.text().to_string());
//! # assert_eq!(name_text.as_deref(), Some(""));
//! # let _ = (street, city, zip, vip);
//! ```
//!
//! # Layout rules
//!
//! - **Rows** go top to bottom in the order they are added, with
//!   [`spacing`](Form::spacing) blank rows between them (1 by default).
//! - **Labels** ([`field`](Form::field)) sit to the left of their field, in
//!   a column as wide as the longest label, or above it with
//!   [`label_position`](Form::label_position). The column can be
//!   right-aligned with [`label_align`](Form::label_align). A label is linked
//!   to its field: clicking it, or pressing Alt and its `~`-marked letter,
//!   focuses the field. An empty label leaves its place blank, so the view
//!   still lines up with the fields.
//! - **Sizes** come from the view: build it with `size(width, height)` to fix
//!   its size, or with `Rect::default()` to let it stretch to the width it is
//!   given, one row high. Stretched views also follow the dialog's width when
//!   it is resized.
//! - **Lines** ([`line`](Form::line)) put several fields side by side. The
//!   first field's label is in the label column; the others' labels sit just
//!   before their fields. Stretched fields in a line share the width left.
//! - **Groups** ([`group`](Form::group) ... [`end_group`](Form::end_group))
//!   draw a titled box around their rows, as wide as the form. A group lines
//!   up its own labels, and groups can nest.
//! - **Full-width rows** ([`row`](Form::row)) start at the label column and
//!   span the whole form or group; [`section`](Form::section) adds a heading
//!   with a blank row above it.
//! - **Buttons** sit on one row at the bottom, centred (or right-aligned with
//!   [`button_align`](Form::button_align)), each at least 10 columns wide.
//! - **The dialog** is sized to fit its contents and its title, and centred
//!   on the desktop when it is executed or added to the desktop.
//!
//! Every view keeps its own behaviour: validators, history lists, colours.
//! The form only sets each view's position and size, through
//! [`View::set_bounds`], once [`build`](Form::build) is called.
